# Lamp-CS-330

 How do I approach designing software?
 I approached the design software by developing a scene that I look at everyday. I have a tencency to make my projects too difficult and end up not finishing it. This way I made a semi- easy project, however, this was proven to be far from the truth! 
 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
New design skills that helped me with my project is the texture. Without the texture I believe that my project would look flat and incomplete even though they were made from 3D shapes. Without the texture and lighting it still doesn't look fully conmpleted. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Before doing anything I drew a design by hand to visualize what my plans were before starting the code. For example, to visualize how I was going to recreate the lamp. Breaking the objects up into simpler shapes helped me visualize my code. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I believe these design tactics could be very helpful in my future work because I could see myself using these techniques with my biomedical engineering degree. By being able to create things with 3D shapes would help me design prosthetics. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I began by devleoping a program that I already know and have done multiple times. For example, creating the camera view or different simple shapes. These were used throughout the semester which gave me lots of practice for this project! 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
New development strategies I tried using was the lighting technique. However, I was unable to get it working in this scene. However, I was able to turn the lights off which put things into perspective on how the light should work.

How did iteration factor into your development?

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
